Programming Historian assist or teaches their audience new technical skills in relation to technology.
Who is the audience for the project?
I believe that this project is specifically for students or those willing to teach or learn new concepts within the digital world.
Would you consider The Programming Historian a work of technical writing/communication? Why? Or, if not, why not?
The contents available within this project are examples of technical writing because it gives a detail instruction or explanation of the specific contents to ensure that their readers can follow and also, understand the reasoning behind the instructions.
