# Lego Flower Room

**By Charles Cho**

## Purpose:

Create an original Lego design that utilizes 10 - 15 pieces (no more, no less).

Compose an instruction set for your design that can be delivered via a digital file or non-digital document -- PowerPoint, Word, PDF, HTML, etc. The delivery medium/format is up to you, but your instruction set must contain both images and words.

Have someone in class attempt to use your instruction set to rebuild your design -- conduct a "usability test" -- and offer you feedback on the instruction set. To assist in sharing our instructional sets with potential builders you can share files to this folder.Timeline/DeadlinesOur goal will be to finish drafting instructions sets during our workshop period. If time permits, we'll conduct usability tests and feedback. Otherwise, we'll open next week with testing and feedback.


## Materials: 

* Two lego windows

* Two 2 x 10-piece legos

* Two 2 x 4-piece legos

* One 2 x 6-piece lego

* One 2 x 8-piece lego

* Three lego flower pieces

* One lego door

* One 8 x 16 thin lego piece


**None of the lego pieces will go off the foundation and should fit completely on or within it.**


## Procedure:

1. Grab the 8 x 16 thin lego and have it laid out in front of you with the long edge near you. This will be the foundation of my little design.

2. Install the two 2 x 10 piece on to the right corner edges of the thin lego piece 

3. Use one of the 2 x 4 pieces and place it at the edge between the two 2 x 10 pieces.

4. Place the other 2 x 4 pieces at the edge of the foundation, next to the 2 x 10 piece farthest away from you.

5. Then, install the 2 x 8 piece on to the left edge of the foundation piece that will fit on the piece without going off of it.

6. There is now space for the door to be installed on to the edge of the foundation between the 2 x 8 and the 2 x 10 pieces.

7. Install the two windows on the left edge, ensuring that the pieces fit perfectly on to the lego pieces.

8. Add the 2 x 6 piece in the middle closest to the windows, but there should be a gap between all the lego pieces placed at the edge.

9. Put the three flowers anywhere on the middle piece to your content.
